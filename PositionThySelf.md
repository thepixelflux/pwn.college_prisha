# Pondering Paths

## Position Thy self
going through Linux filesystem which has tons of directories with tons of files. how can we navigate around directories by using the cd (change directory) command and passing a path to it as an argument.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Qiagq28cMNPcE5nYTzdIfxmUJjC.QX2QTN0wiN5EzNzEzW}`


```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ ~
bash: /home/hacker: Is a directory
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /home/hacker
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/build-essential directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /usr/share/build-essential
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/build-essential$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Qiagq28cMNPcE5nYTzdIfxmUJjC.QX2QTN0wiN5EzNzEzW}
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/build-essential$
```

using ~ to know the current directory path where our shell is located at.
then moving to xecute the /challenge/run program from a specific path which is generated by the system. after that using c d again to that directory before rerunning the challenge program
