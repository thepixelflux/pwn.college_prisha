# Chaining commands

## Your first shell scrript
Same as last level, run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, but this time in a shell script called x.sh, then run it with bash!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UlfxCr99f3vxzbJsQl585UaR-Bg.QXxcDO0wiN5EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{UlfxCr99f3vxzbJsQl585UaR-Bg.QXxcDO0wiN5EzNzEzW}
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ 
```
