# Hello Hackers

## Command History
we can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ua7gk3NWqJ-XAFe4R6oqW5iqJwW.0lNzEzNxwiN5EzNzEzW}`
type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for any bash commands and output you type on the terminal.

```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{Ua7gk3NWqJ-XAFe4R6oqW5iqJwW.0lNzEzNxwiN5EzNzEzW}^C
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ 
```

### New Learnings
I learned that by hitting the up arrow ,the history that appears,this history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it instead of typing again and again
