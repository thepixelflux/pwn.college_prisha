# Comprehending Commands

## more catting practise
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it in the file /opt/pt-dump/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that directory!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for any bash commands and output you type on the terminal.

```bash
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /opt/pt-dump/flag
pwn.college{snvD6E0nX33WWrVJ6FFKS-6jE-q.QXwITO0wiN5EzNzEzW}
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ 
```

### New Learnings
how to change directories with cd, so no cat flag for you. How to retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.
