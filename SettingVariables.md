# Shell variables

## Setting Variables
To solve this level, you must set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. Be careful: both the names and values of variables are case-sensitive! PWN is not the same as pwn and COLLEGE is not the same as College.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EDitxiy7t6qiq2bTjnSubFf1SJ4.QX5UTN0wiN5EzNzEzW}`


```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{EDitxiy7t6qiq2bTjnSubFf1SJ4.QX5UTN0wiN5EzNzEzW}
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ 
```
