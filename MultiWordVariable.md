# Shell Variable

## Multi word variable
Here, the shell reads 1337 SAUCE as a single token, and happily sets that value to VAR. In this level, you'll need to set the variable PWN to COLLEGE YEAH

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cD2-r-A-tAdBps5FCROKg1csd22.QXwYTN0wiN5EzNzEzW}`


```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{cD2-r-A-tAdBps5FCROKg1csd22.QXwYTN0wiN5EzNzEzW}
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ 
```
