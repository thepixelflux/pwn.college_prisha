# Intro To Arguments

## Challenge Name
In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the hello command (NOT the echo command) with a single argument of hackers. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{07APdWdJgL8d0ZBjp9QBOvao4h-.QX4YjM1wiN5EzNzEzW}`

Just like in the previous challenge the command was echo, and the argument was Hello as echo was written first then hello followed it. echo is a simple command that "echoes" all of its arguments back out onto the terminal.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{07APdWdJgL8d0ZBjp9QBOvao4h-.QX4YjM1wiN5EzNzEzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ 
```

### New Learnings
I learned that the first word that we write on the terminal is the command, and the subsequent words that follow it are arguments.
