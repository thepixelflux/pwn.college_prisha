# Terminal Multiplexing

## Launching screen
For this challenge, we've hooked things up so that just launching screen will get you the flag

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oNOllt2Lj-wWB4W5MG03xYkRvGm.0VN4IDOxwiN5EzNzEzW}`

```bash
Congratulations! You're inside a screen session!
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{oNOllt2Lj-wWB4W5MG03xYkRvGm.0VN4IDOxwiN5EzNzEzW}
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~launching-screen:~$
```
### New Learnings
screen is a program that creates virtual terminals inside your terminal. It's somewhat like having multiple browser tabs, but for your command line!
